# Drug-Screening-For-AD
A retrospective MCI cohort was assembled following the criteria illustrated in Figure 1. An initial case-control screening was conducted to identify potential drug-disease associations. MCI patients were defined as cases who subsequently developed AD. Controls were individuals without an AD diagnosis at any time. Subjects with at least one documentation of an AD code and no exposure to an approved AD drug are termed “Status undetermined” and are removed from the analysis. 
Exposure algorithms incorporated the dispense and request data structure in TRUVETA. Subjects were classified as exposed if they had ≥1 dispense with ≥15 total days’ supply or ≥2 dispenses, or ≥2 requests; unexposed if no dispense or request records. Incomplete or inconsistent fill records were categorized as undetermined. Parallel analyses were done on both the new-user and the prevalent-user designs. Subjects with first drug initiation after MCI are classified as new users. The index date was defined as the first recorded MCI diagnosis.
