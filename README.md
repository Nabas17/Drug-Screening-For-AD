# Drug-Screening-For-AD

## Overview

This repository contains a reproducible analytic pipeline for screening drug associations with progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) using real-world electronic health record (EHR) data from Truveta.

The objective of this project is to build a scalable framework that:

- Constructs an incident MCI cohort
- Defines drug-specific exposure groups
- Implements new-user and prevalent-user study designs
- Performs multivariable logistic regression
- Enables automated screening across multiple drug candidates

This pipeline is designed for hypothesis generation and signal prioritization prior to causal validation (e.g., target trial emulation).

## Repository Structure

### 📂 `ADSL.ipynb`
**Cohort construction and study design**

Responsible for:

- Applying inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Defining incident MCI cohort
- Defining case (MCI → AD) and control groups
- Establishing index date (first recorded MCI diagnosis)
- Removing patients with prior AD or related dementia
- Implementing healthcare history requirements
- Classifying new-user vs prevalent-user designs

**Output:** Final analytic cohort dataset.

---

### 📂 `Condition_encounter_r.ipynb`
**Comorbidity and covariate construction**

- Extracts diagnosis and encounter data
- Generates comorbidity indicators within 1 year prior to index date:
  - Hypertension
  - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
  - Depression
  - Stroke
  - Ischemic Heart Disease
- Produces covariate-ready dataset for regression models

---

### 📂 `medication_exposure.ipynb`
**Drug exposure algorithm**

Implements standardized exposure classification using dispense and request data.

Subjects are classified as:

- **Exposed**:
  - ≥1 dispense with ≥15 total days' supply OR
  - ≥2 dispenses OR
  - ≥2 request records

- **Unexposed**:
  - No dispense or request records

- **Undetermined**:
  - Incomplete or inconsistent fill records

Creates drug-specific exposure tables for downstream analysis.

### 📂 (Planned) `analysis_pipeline.ipynb`
**Automated drug screening framework**

This module will:

- Accept a drug name as input
- Merge cohort + comorbidities + exposure data
- Apply both new-user and prevalent-user study designs
- Fit multivariable logistic regression models
- Estimate Odds Ratios (OR) and 95% Confidence Intervals
- Generate results for:
  - Full cohort
  - Discovery set
  - Validation set

This enables scalable and automated screening across multiple drugs with minimal manual intervention.

---

## Study Design Summary

- **Population:** Adults ≥65 years with incident MCI
- **Outcome:** Incident AD diagnosis
- **Exposure:** Drug-specific algorithm based on dispense/request records
- **Designs:** New-user and prevalent-user
- **Covariates:** Age, sex, race, and comorbidities assessed within 1 year pre-index
- **Analysis:** Multivariable logistic regression
- **Validation:** Temporal split into discovery and validation cohorts

---

## Analytical Framework

For each drug:

1. Define exposure status
2. Merge exposure with cohort and covariates
3. Run adjusted logistic regression
4. Estimate OR and 95% CI
5. Compare results across:
   - New-user vs prevalent-user designs
   - Discovery vs validation sets

---

## Purpose

This repository supports:

- Large-scale screening of candidate repurposed drugs
- Standardized and reproducible exposure definitions
- Efficient prioritization of drug signals
- Comparative evaluation of study design assumptions

The results generated by this pipeline represent screening-level associations and should not be interpreted as causal estimates.

---

## Future Directions

- Target trial emulation
- Propensity score methods
- Balance diagnostics
- Sensitivity analyses using alternative exposure definitions
- External validation in independent datasets

---

## Notes

This pipeline is optimized for large EHR datasets and modular expansion.  
Additional drug candidates can be evaluated by supplying the drug name to the analysis module.
